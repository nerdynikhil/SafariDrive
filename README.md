‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL SAFETY DISCLAIMER**

This project is a **RESEARCH PROTOTYPE ONLY** and demonstrates technical concepts that:
- Should NOT be implemented in real vehicles
- Must NOT be used while driving
- Are intended purely for academic study
- Could be potentially dangerous or lethal if misused

## ‚ùå Important Notice

Web browsing while driving is:
- Extremely dangerous
- Illegal in most jurisdictions
- Explicitly discouraged by automotive safety organizations
- NOT a feature that should be implemented in CarPlay

## üî¨ Research Purpose

This repository exists solely to:
- Study iOS and CarPlay development patterns
- Document technical integration possibilities
- Aid academic research
- Explore system boundaries

## ‚öñÔ∏è Legal Notice

This is an experimental prototype only. The developers:
- Strongly oppose web browsing while driving
- Do not endorse implementation in vehicles
- Support all driving safety regulations
- Recommend focusing solely on allowed CarPlay features

## üìö Educational Context

This code base should be viewed as:
- A technical exercise
- A research document
- NOT production-ready code
- NOT for real-world implementation

## üîí License
